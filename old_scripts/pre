? problems that arise when grouping up robots

?? group too big / too small
??? split up / combine
???? subareas of beacons 
???? small distinct groups planned together

?? how to plan for groups that cross paths
??? if possible detour (maybe togglable even for comparison)
???? if possible groups beacons can't be the same
??? plan seperately after another 
???? depends on group size, manhattan distance
??? plan together
